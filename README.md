# NobuOSS
A OSS bot made in c# using DsharpPlus

Thanks for checking out my repository!

It's my second ever open source project which I am very excited about.

If you need help with the installation and setup of the bot I'll list in here:

1. download this repository via a zip

2. Unzip the file

3. Open the .sln file

4. Locate the config.json file in the project

5. Add your bot token and change the prfix if you'd like

6. Locate the other config.json file in NobuOSS-master/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1

7. edit the file and add your token and prefix into there too

You should be all set with the basic setup.

REDDIT COMMANDS

Setup for this should be simple

1. Locate the RedditCommands file and open it

2. Locate the variable called r

2.5 this is a video to help setup reddit commands by the creator of this library: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlWhLyVgN2s PS: I used personal script

3. After getting the tokens out them into the variable r (the app secret and app ID will be on the application you create in od.reddit.com)

4. Then locate the variable called subreddit and input the name of the subreddit you want inside the string

5. You should be all set for getting reddit posts from your bot and sending them inside the channel
